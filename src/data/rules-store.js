/**
 * RULES STORE
 * ===========
 * One live copy of the rule list, shared by every screen that reads or writes
 * it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Rule groups held the list in `useState(RULES)` and Add rule
 * held its draft in its own component state, so "Complete Rule" could only ever
 * fire a toast and navigate away — the new rule had nowhere to go, and the list
 * it landed back on was rebuilt from the original module constant. The same
 * applied to enabling, reordering and deleting: every edit was reverted by the
 * next navigation, while the toast said it had worked. A confirmation for
 * something that did not happen is worse than no confirmation.
 *
 * WHY NOT CONTEXT. Rules are read by three sibling routes and written by two.
 * A provider would have to sit at the router root and thread through pages that
 * do not care about rules, for state that is genuinely app-global. An external
 * store subscribed to with `useSyncExternalStore` keeps the pages unchanged
 * apart from the hook they call.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE is deliberate: a rule added during a demo survives a reload, so
 * "let me show you the rule I just built" works after a refresh. A corrupt or
 * stale payload falls back to the seed rather than taking the page down —
 * a saved preference must never be able to break a screen.
